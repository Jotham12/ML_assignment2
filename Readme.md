This is a reinforcement learning assignment2 
Scenario1.py 
    This file will run the simple scenario where the Q-Learning algorithm will find the shortest path to the 
    RED package 

Scenario2.py 
    This file will run a multi scenario where the Q-learning algorithm will try to find three different packages
    in the envronment. 

Scenario3.py 
    This file will run a rgb scenario where the Q-learning algorithm will try to find three different packages 
    sequentially in the environment. 

FourRooms.py 
    This file has the helper functions necessary to run the Q-learning algorithm.
