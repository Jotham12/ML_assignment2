This is a reinforcement learning assignment2 
Scenario1.py 
    This file will run the simple scenario where the Q-Learning algorithm will find the shortest path to the 
    RED package 

Scenario2.py 
    This file will run a multi scenario where the Q-learning algorithm will try to find three different packages
    in the environment. 

Scenario3.py 
    This file will run a rgb scenario where the Q-learning algorithm will try to find three different packages 
    sequentially in the environment. 

FourRooms.py 
    This file has the helper functions necessary to run the Q-learning algorithm. 

    
 To run my files you will use the Makefile where you will just type 'Make' on the terminal but there are three scenarios
 each ask the user if he/she will like to use stochastic, that's 'yes/no' answer for each file.
